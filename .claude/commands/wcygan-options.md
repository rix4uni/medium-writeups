# /options

Analyze different approaches for the given task or problem, providing a comprehensive comparison of options with benefits, trade-offs, and effort estimates.

## Usage

```
/options [task or problem description]
```

## Instructions

For the given task or problem, provide a structured analysis following this format:

### 1. Problem Understanding

- Clearly restate the problem/goal
- Identify key requirements and constraints
- List any assumptions being made

### 2. Approach Options

For each viable approach (aim for 3-5 options):

#### Option [N]: [Descriptive Name]

**Overview**: Brief description of the approach

**Benefits**:

- List 3-5 key advantages
- Focus on technical and business value

**Trade-offs**:

- List 2-4 potential drawbacks or limitations
- Be honest about complexity or risks

**Implementation Details**:

- High-level steps required
- Key technologies or patterns involved
- Integration points or dependencies

**Effort Estimate**:

- **Complexity**: Low/Medium/High
- **Time**: Rough estimate (hours/days/weeks)
- **Team Size**: Solo developer / Small team / Large team
- **Maintenance**: Ongoing effort required

**Best For**: Describe scenarios where this approach excels

### 3. Recommendation Matrix

Create a comparison table:

| Approach | Complexity | Time | Risk | Scalability | Maintainability | Overall Score |
| -------- | ---------- | ---- | ---- | ----------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| Option 1 | Low        | 2d   | Low  | Medium      | High            | 7/10          |
| Option 2 | High       | 2w   | Med  | High        | Medium          | 6/10          |
| etc...   |            |      |      |             |                 |               |

### 4. Recommended Approach

- State your primary recommendation with rationale
- Suggest a fallback option if the primary fails
- Highlight any critical decision points

### 5. Next Steps

- List immediate actions for the chosen approach
- Identify what additional information might be needed
- Suggest proof-of-concept or validation steps

## Guidelines

- Be objective and data-driven in analysis
- Consider both short-term and long-term implications
- Include non-technical factors (team skills, deadlines, budget)
- Provide actionable insights, not just theoretical comparisons
- When possible, reference similar successful implementations

## Example
