Create a commit, push to remote, and open a pull request.

Steps:

1. Run git status and git diff to see current changes
2. Create a meaningful commit with the message: $ARGUMENTS
3. Push the current branch to remote (with -u flag if needed)
4. Create a pull request using gh cli with an appropriate title and description
5. Return the PR URL

If no commit message is provided in $ARGUMENTS, analyze the changes and generate an appropriate commit message.
