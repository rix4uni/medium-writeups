# /tldr

Generate concise, actionable summaries of complex topics, documentation, codebases, or discussions. Focus on essential information and immediate next steps.

## Usage

```
/tldr [topic, document, codebase, or discussion]
```

## Summary Framework

### Key Principles

- **Brevity**: Maximum 5 bullet points per section
- **Actionability**: Focus on what to do, not just what to know
- **Hierarchy**: Most important information first
- **Clarity**: Use simple, direct language
- **Context**: Include just enough background for understanding

### Structure Template

```markdown

- [Second most important point]
- [Third critical element]
- [Supporting detail if needed]
- [Context or constraint]

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. [Immediate action - what to do first]
2. [Follow-up action - what to do next]
3. [Future consideration - what to plan for]

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Notes

- [Important warning or constraint]

```

## Summarization Techniques

### Information Hierarchy

1. **Critical**: Must know for immediate action
2. **Important**: Affects decision-making
3. **Useful**: Provides helpful context
4. **Interesting**: Nice to know but not essential

### The 5W+H Filter

- **Who**: Key people/stakeholders
- **What**: Core facts/decisions
- **When**: Critical timelines
- **Where**: Location/context constraints
- **Why**: Essential reasoning
- **How**: Implementation approach

### Progressive Disclosure

```markdown
## 30-Second Version

[One paragraph with absolute essentials]

## 2-Minute Version

[Add key details and context]

## 5-Minute Version

[Include important nuances and background]
```

## Examples by Use Case

### Codebase Analysis TL;DR

```markdown
# TL;DR: Payment Service

## What It Does

Processes credit card payments through Stripe with retry logic and fraud detection.

## Key Files

- `payment_processor.rs`: Main business logic
- `stripe_client.rs`: External API integration
- `fraud_detector.rs`: Risk assessment rules

## To Debug Issues

1. Check logs in `/var/log/payments/`
2. Verify Stripe webhook status
3. Look for fraud blocks in dashboard

## Critical Dependencies

- Stripe API (payment processing)
- Redis (rate limiting)
- Postgres (transaction history)

### Architecture Decision TL;DR

```markdown
# TL;DR: Database Choice - ScyllaDB

## Decision

Migrate from Postgres to ScyllaDB for event storage.

## Why

- 10x better write performance at scale
- Native time-series support
- Compatible with Cassandra tools

## Next Steps

1. Proof of concept by Jan 15
2. Migration plan by Feb 1
3. Production rollout Q2

## Risks

- Team learning curve (2-3 weeks)
- Data migration complexity
- Operational tooling gaps

## Resources

- ScyllaDB docs: [link]
- POC repository: [link]
- Migration champion: Alex Kim
```

### Bug Investigation TL;DR

```markdown
# TL;DR: Login Timeout Bug

## Problem

Users getting logged out after 5 minutes instead of 30 minutes.

## Root Cause

JWT expiration misconfigured in auth service config.

## Fix Applied

Changed `token_expiry` from 300s to 1800s in `auth.yaml`

## Prevention

- Added integration test for token expiry
- Documented config in runbook
- Set up monitoring alert for short sessions

## Status: RESOLVED (deployed to prod 2024-01-15)
```

### Research Summary TL;DR

```markdown
# TL;DR: State Management Options

## Recommendation

Use Zustand for client state, React Query for server state.

## Why

- Simpler than Redux (less boilerplate)
- Better TypeScript support
- Proven at scale (used by Vercel, etc.)

## Implementation

1. Replace Redux store with Zustand (1 week)
2. Add React Query for API calls (1 week)
3. Remove unnecessary middleware (2 days)

## Tradeoffs

- ‚úÖ Faster development, fewer bugs
- ‚ùå Team relearning curve
- ‚ùå Less ecosystem/tooling than Redux
```

## Quality Checklist

### Essential Elements

- [ ] Can be read in under 2 minutes
- [ ] Includes concrete next steps
- [ ] Highlights biggest risks/concerns
- [ ] Provides contact info or resources
- [ ] Uses bullet points and short sentences

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ‚ùå Including too much background/context
- ‚ùå Using jargon without explanation
- ‚ùå Listing facts without actionable conclusions
- ‚ùå Burying the most important information
- ‚ùå Making it longer than the original content

### Audience Considerations

- **Executive**: Focus on business impact and timeline
- **Technical**: Include implementation details and risks
- **Operational**: Emphasize process and responsibilities
- **Cross-functional**: Balance technical and business context

## Integration with Other Commands

- Use after `/investigate` to summarize findings
- Apply to `/deep-dive` outputs to extract key insights
- Follow `/think` sessions to distill conclusions
- Create TL;DR versions of `/elaborate` content
- Summarize `/dependencies` analysis for stakeholders

The goal is to make complex information immediately accessible and actionable for busy stakeholders who need to make quick, informed decisions.
