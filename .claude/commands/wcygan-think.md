# /think

Engage in structured, multi-angle reasoning about a topic, problem, or decision to generate deep insights and novel perspectives through systematic contemplation.

## Usage

```
/think [topic, problem, question, or decision]
```

## Thinking Framework

### Phase 1: Problem Framing

**Define the Core Question**

- What exactly are we trying to understand or solve?
- What assumptions are we making?
- What constraints and boundaries exist?
- What would success look like?

**Establish Context**

- Historical background and precedents
- Current state and influencing factors
- Stakeholder perspectives and interests
- Environmental and systemic considerations

### Phase 2: Multi-Angle Analysis

**First Principles Thinking**

- Break down to fundamental truths and building blocks
- Question basic assumptions and conventional wisdom
- Identify root causes vs. symptoms
- Reconstruct understanding from the ground up

**Systems Thinking**

- Map interconnections and feedback loops
- Identify emergent properties and side effects
- Consider second and third-order consequences
- Analyze system dynamics and behavior patterns

**Contrarian Perspective**

- What would the opposite approach look like?
- What are the strongest counterarguments?
- Where might conventional wisdom be wrong?
- What are the hidden downsides of popular solutions?

**Temporal Analysis**

- How has this problem/topic evolved over time?
- What are the current trends and trajectories?
- What might change in the short/medium/long term?
- How do time horizons affect the analysis?

**Stakeholder Viewpoints**

- How would different parties see this differently?
- What are their incentives and constraints?
- Where do interests align or conflict?
- What perspectives might be missing?

### Phase 3: Creative Exploration

**Analogical Thinking**

- How is this similar to problems in other domains?
- What can we learn from nature, history, or other fields?
- What metaphors or models might apply?
- How do other industries handle similar challenges?

**Scenario Planning**

- What are the best-case, worst-case, and most likely scenarios?
- What would happen if key assumptions changed?
- What external factors could significantly impact outcomes?
- How robust are potential solutions across scenarios?

**Inversion Thinking**

- What would failure look like, and how could we avoid it?
- What are we trying NOT to achieve?
- What would make this problem worse?
- How might we accidentally create new problems?

**Combinatorial Thinking**

- What happens if we combine different approaches?
- What new possibilities emerge from unexpected combinations?
- How might seemingly unrelated concepts connect?
- What novel solutions might exist at the intersections?

### Phase 4: Critical Evaluation

**Logical Consistency**

- Are the arguments internally consistent?
- Where might there be logical fallacies or gaps?
- What evidence supports or contradicts key claims?
- How strong are the causal relationships?

**Practical Feasibility**

- What are the real-world implementation challenges?
- What resources and capabilities would be required?
- What are the technical, financial, and organizational constraints?
- How would this work in practice, not just in theory?

**Risk Assessment**

- What could go wrong and how likely is it?
- What are the potential costs of failure?
- How reversible are the decisions?
- What contingency plans might be needed?

**Unintended Consequences**

- What second-order effects might emerge?
- How might the solution create new problems?
- What behaviors might be incentivized?
- How might the system adapt or respond?

### Phase 5: Synthesis and Insight Generation

**Pattern Recognition**

- What patterns emerge across different angles of analysis?
- Where do multiple perspectives converge?
- What themes or principles appear repeatedly?
- What unexpected connections were discovered?

**Insight Articulation**

- [Unstated assumptions to question]
- [Biases that might be affecting judgment]
```

**Decision Framework**

```markdown
## Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria

1. [Most important factor - weight %]
2. [Second factor - weight %]
3. [Third factor - weight %]

### Option Analysis

| Option | Criterion 1 | Criterion 2 | Criterion 3 | Overall |
| ------ | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------- |
| A      | Score       | Score       | Score       | Total   |
| B      | Score       | Score       | Score       | Total   |

### Recommendation

[Reasoned recommendation based on analysis]
```

### Phase 6: Action-Oriented Output

**Strategic Implications**

- How does this thinking change our understanding?
- What strategic shifts might be warranted?
- What new opportunities or threats are revealed?
- How should priorities be adjusted?

**Tactical Recommendations**

- What specific actions should be taken?
- What experiments or pilots could test key assumptions?
- What additional information should be gathered?
- What decisions can be deferred vs. need immediate attention?

**Implementation Considerations**

- What are the prerequisites for moving forward?
- How should this be communicated to stakeholders?
- What resources or support will be needed?
- What metrics would indicate success or failure?

## Thinking Techniques

### Socratic Questioning

- What do we think we know about this?
- How do we know what we know?
- What questions does this raise?
- What if we're wrong about our core assumptions?

### Devil's Advocate

- What's the strongest case against this approach?
- Where are the weakest points in the reasoning?
- What would critics say about this analysis?
- How might we be fooling ourselves?

### Steelman Technique

- What's the strongest possible version of alternative viewpoints?
- How might opposing arguments be improved?
- Where might critics have valid points?
- What can we learn from the strongest counterarguments?

### Pre-mortem Analysis

- Imagine this approach failed completely - what went wrong?
- What warning signs should we watch for?
- What could we do differently to prevent failure?
- How would we recognize problems early?

## Integration with Other Commands

- Use before `/options` to thoroughly explore the problem space
- Combine with `/investigate` for evidence-based input to thinking
- Follow with `/plan` to organize implementation of insights
- Use with `/elaborate` to work through complex reasoning
- Apply `/deep-dive` to specific aspects that need further exploration

The goal is to develop nuanced understanding that leads to better decisions and more creative solutions through rigorous, multi-perspective reasoning.
