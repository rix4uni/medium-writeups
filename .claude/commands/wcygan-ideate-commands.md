Given the following context about a project or situation, suggest 5-10 useful slash commands that could automate common tasks or workflows. For each command idea, provide:

1. **Command name** (what would follow `/project:`)
2. **Purpose** - One-line description of what it does
3. **Key actions** - 2-3 bullet points of main steps
4. **Parameters** - Whether it needs `$ARGUMENTS` and what they'd be used for
5. **Example usage** - How someone would invoke it

Context to analyze:
$ARGUMENTS

Consider commands that could help with:

- Repetitive development tasks
- Code quality and consistency
- Debugging and troubleshooting
- Documentation and knowledge sharing
- Team collaboration workflows
- Project setup and configuration
- Testing and validation
- Performance optimization
- Security and compliance
- Release and deployment processes

Prioritize commands that:

- Save significant time on frequent tasks
- Reduce human error in complex processes
- Standardize team practices
- Lower barriers for new contributors
- Address pain points specific to this context

Format the output as a structured list with clear sections for each command idea. Focus on practical, high-impact automation that can be immediately implemented.
