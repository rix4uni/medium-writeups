Map out the high-level strategy, goals, and checkpoints for the initiative: $ARGUMENTS

## Analysis Steps:

1. **Understand the Initiative**
   - Parse the provided description or context
   - Identify the core problem being solved
   - Determine the target audience/users
   - Assess the scope and constraints

2. **Define Strategic Goals**
   - Break down the initiative into 3-5 major strategic goals
   - Ensure goals are SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
   - Prioritize goals by impact and dependencies

3. **Create Milestone Checkpoints**
   - Define clear, measurable checkpoints for each goal
   - Establish success criteria for each checkpoint
   - Set realistic timelines with buffer for unknowns
   - Identify dependencies between checkpoints

4. **Risk Assessment**
   - Identify potential blockers or risks
   - Plan mitigation strategies
   - Define fallback approaches

5. **Resource Planning**
   - Estimate effort required for each checkpoint
   - Identify skills/tools needed
   - Note any external dependencies

## Output Format:
